## Introduction
Has anyone ever had experiences like this? I remember owning a certain piece of clothing, but I can't recall whether it's at home or at school 🤔. The clothes I neatly folded get messy again every time I search for something 😦. A pile of shoe boxes — to find one specific pair of shoes, you have to open each box, and in the end, you still can’t find it 😠. Meat stored in the fridge during the Spring Festival that isn’t discovered until mid-year 😵…

To solve the problem of "difficulty in finding specific items when things are piled up", I developed the home storage system "StackEverything". Unlike traditional warehouse systems that focus on tracking item quantities, StackEverything focuses on tracking item locations.

With this system, you can track where each item is, like finding your clothes in a pile without digging through everything; You can record medicine expiration dates so you don’t find out they’re expired when you try to use them; You can use it with your family so you don’t have to call for mom when something is missing... In short, this system helps you keep track of anything that gets piled up, so nothing gets lost or forgotten.


## Features
1. **📁Easy-to-use UI**  
The main interface is designed similarly to Windows Explorer, which ensures that users are familiar with the operations such as directory switching.

2. **🕹️Intuitive Interaction**  
Drag and drop items to move them, with glowing indicators guiding precise operations.

3. **🪄Multiple Movement Modes**  
In addition to basic single-item dragging, StackEverything provides four convenient movement modes: Multi, Insert, Absorb, and Portal. For detailed instructions, please refer to the "Help Document" page inside the system.

4. **🎛️Custom Classes & Properties**  
You can freely add classes and properties for items, making it easier to search for them later.

5. **🔎Convenience Item Search**  
You can search items by name, class, whether they are virtual, expiration date and whether they have children. When searching by class, you can further filter results by properties. The fields displayed after filtering can also be customized.

6. **🛜Access Anywhere on Local Network**  
As long as one machine on the local network is running the software, any device connected to the same network can access StackEverything through a web browser, allowing you to take advantage of each device's strengths.

## FAQ
Q1: Does that mean I have to operate your system every time I take out a piece of clothing?  
A1: Not necessarily. For example, I keep my seasonal clothes in a separate pile, and I won’t update the system when I use them. However, during seasonal transitions, it's important to make sure the order of items in the system matches the real-world arrangement — otherwise the system loses its value.  

Q2: Isn't your system kind of "butter on bacon"?  
A2: It really depends on personal needs. If you only have a small number of items and can easily remember where everything is, then using this system might indeed feel unnecessary. But when the number of items grows large enough, and the frequency of use becomes low enough, our memory just isn’t reliable anymore — and that’s when tools like this become useful. For example, do you really know what exactly is in that storage room at home right now? With this system, you will — and that’s exactly its purpose.
